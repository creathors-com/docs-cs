## Deleting a Coupon

::callout{color="amber" icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
Deleting a coupon prevents it from being applied to future subscriptions or customers, but it doesnâ€™t remove the discount from any subscription or customer that already has it.
::

You can simply delete a coupon by clicking the trash icon in the coupon row.
