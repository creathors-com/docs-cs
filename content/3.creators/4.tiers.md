Tiers are used to lock your [posts](/creators/posts) behind a subscription.

## Managing Tiers

You can manage tiers at [**Dashboard** > **Tiers**](https://dashboard.creathors.com/tiers).

## Creating Tiers

When creating a tier, you must define these fields:

::card

| ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field       | Example                | Description                                                       |
| Name        | VIP                    | Displayed name of the subscription.                               |

| Description | Access to VIP content. | Description of the subscription.                                  |

After filling these fields, simply click the **Add Tier** button, and you can use it right away.

## Editing Tiers

::callout{color="amber" icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
When editing a price, it doesn't update current subscriptions. It only affects subscriptions created after the change.
::

Editing tiers works the same way and uses the same form as when you create a new tier. Simply click the **Edit** button on the tier card.

## Subscribers

You can see current subscribers to a tier by expanding the tier row.

## Deleting Tiers

::callout{color="amber" icon="i-heroicons-exclamation-triangle"}
Deleting a tier automatically cancels all subscriptions tied to it immediately.
::

If you want to delete a subscription so that no one can use or buy it anymore, simply click the trash icon on the tier card.
