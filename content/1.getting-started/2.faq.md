## What is Creathors?

The Creathors Platform is a place for creators of any kind to share their work with their fans, whether it be videos, images, or simple thoughts they want to share with their community.

We strive to make it as easy as possible for creators to focus on what they love by giving them the ability to monetize their work through subscriptions and/or pay-per-view.

Even though monetization is the main idea behind the Creathors Platform, we also offer creators the option to share their work publicly, without hiding it behind a paywall.

## What is pay-per-view?

You might be familiar with the subscription model, where people pay a monthly fee to gain access to exclusive content. But what is pay-per-view, and how does it work?

Pay-per-view allows fans to unlock a specific post by paying a one-time, often lower price, instead of subscribing at a higher price.

This option is perfect for fans who want access to very specific posts and might not be interested in other content that comes with subscriptions.
